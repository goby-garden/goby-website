# Goby is a tool for enriching [Are.na](are.na) channels with custom metadata.

It lets you add/organize new fields for your blocks with different types of information:
* Short text strings
* Longform text with markdown
* URLs
* Tags 

You can see the work in progress at [goby.garden](https://goby.garden), and learn more about the project in [my Are.na channel](https://www.are.na/nico-chilla/approaching-goby-u9rrzm6iqee). I will eventually add a formal explanation of it here as well.
