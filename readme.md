Goby will be an interface for organizing stored files and abstract information. Goby was originally [a web app](https://goby.garden) that enriched Are.na blocks with metadata. But itâ€™s now expanding to a project about structuring data stored anywhere you want according to logical patterns.

Conceptually, it is inspired by [ontology engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_engineering) and [object storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_storage) in information science, and it aspires to make this level of abstraction possible for individual users organizing their files or other data. Functionally, it is inspired by Are.na, Notion, and Obsidian, combining different traits from each and adding some functionality beyond all of them.
